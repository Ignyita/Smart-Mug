# Smart-Mug
The Smart Mug project is an innovative device that is designed to maintain the temperature of a beverage at a specified level
 It is equipped with a temperature sensor, PTC heater  and an Arduino microcontroller, which is programmed to regulate the heating elements inside the mug. The device features a local web interface, which has been developed using the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages. 
Apparatus specifications
1.DHT11 sensor
Digital temperature and humidity sensors like the DHT11 are inexpensive.  Any micro-controller, including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc., may easily interface with this sensor to instantly monitor humidity and temperature.
The DHT11 sensor is made up of a capacitive humidity measuring element and a thermistor for temperature detection.  A moisture-holding substrate serves as a dielectric between the two electrodes of the humidity sensor capacitor. The capacitance value changes as the humidity level changes. The IC measures, processes, and converts the resistance values into digital form.
DHT11 has a temperature range of 0 to 50 degrees Celsius with a 2-degree accuracy. This sensor has a humidity range of 20 to 80% with a 5% accuracy. This sensor has a sampling rate of 1Hz, which means it takes one reading per second.  DHT11 is a tiny device with an operational voltage range of 3 to 5 volts. The highest measurement current is 2.5mA.
